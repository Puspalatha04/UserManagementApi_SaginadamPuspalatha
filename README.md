A simple ASP.NET Core Web API for managing users, built as part of a three‑stage activity series using Microsoft Copilot.
This project demonstrates CRUD operations, input validation, debugging, and middleware implementation for logging, authentication, and global error handling.

Activities Performed

Activity 1: Writing and Enhancing API Code
In this activity, Microsoft Copilot was used to scaffold an ASP.NET Core Web API project and generate CRUD operations for user management. The API allows creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting users using RESTful endpoints, forming the core functionality of the application.

Activity 2: Debugging API Code
The second activity focused on debugging and improving API reliability. Copilot assisted in identifying issues such as missing validations, invalid input handling, and errors when accessing non‑existent users. Input validation and error handling were added to ensure stable and predictable API behavior.

Activity 3: Middleware Implementation
In the final activity, Microsoft Copilot was used to implement middleware for logging, token‑based authentication, and global error handling. The middleware pipeline was configured in the correct order to ensure secure access, consistent error responses, and detailed request and response logging.
